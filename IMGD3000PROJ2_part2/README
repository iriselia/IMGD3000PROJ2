----Project2-
Platform: Windows/Visual Studio with CMake
Description:
I wrote some CMake scripts to organize the source files. It is very flexible and allows the
unwieldy MSVC solution to easily compile on any windows computer.

Sample saucer game runs no problem, except the viewobject is disabled due to class scheduling.
Had to change some code from professor to run, ViewObject was undefined, etc.

I failed to submit part2 correctly the first time.
If part2 is considered late, please treat it optionally.

----How to use:
Install CMake on windows.

Open cmake and type in the root directory of the project.
This path should include CMakeLists.txt, a CMake folder, and a 3rdParty folder.

Set the output path as *replace this section with your root directory*/Build.

Next, click Configure, choose the compiler you are using, however choose the x86 version,
not 64 bit, nor the ARM verison.

Click generate.

Go to the Build folder under the root directory. The solution should be created,
all necessary settings should be set based on your environment.

Build and run.
